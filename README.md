# Extention-for-learning-time-complexity

* As a Computer Science student learning and memorising time complexities of various Data Structures and Algorithms is challenging.
* So to make it easy, I made a Google Chrome extention that displays a random time complexity of algorithm.
* Each time someone clicks on that extention it shows best time, average time and worst time complexities of any random algorithm.
